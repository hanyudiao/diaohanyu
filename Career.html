<!--The experience -of the youngest Ronaldo-><!---->
<p class="thick">Sporting CP</p>
<p>At age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting's youth team by first-team manager László Bölöni, who was impressed with his dribbling.He subsequently became the first player to play for the club's under-16, under-17 and under-18 teams, the B team, and the first team, all within a single season.A year later, on 7 October 2002, Ronaldo made his debut in the Primeira Liga, against Moreirense, and scored two goals in their 3–0 win.Over the course of the 2002–03 season, his representatives suggested the player to  

  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.">Liverpool</a>manager Gérard Houllier and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona">Barcelona</a> president Joan Laporta.Manager Arsène Wenger, who was interested in signing the winger, met with him at Arsenal's grounds in November to discuss a possible transfer.</p>

<!--The growing Ronaldo-->
<p class="thick">Manchester United</p>
<p>Ronaldo became Manchester United's first-ever Portuguese player when he signed before the 2003–04 season. His transfer fee of £12.24 million made him, at the time, the most expensive teenager in English football history.Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received the number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best, Eric Cantona and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Beckham">David Beckham</a>. Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo.A key element in his development during his time in England proved to be his manager, Alex Ferguson, of whom he later said, "He's been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my career."</p>

<p>Ronaldo made his debut in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League">Premier League</a> in a 4–0 home victory over Bolton Wanderers on 16 August 2003, receiving a standing ovation when he came on as a 60th-minute substitute for Nicky Butt.His performance earned praise from George Best, who hailed it as "undoubtedly the most exciting debut" he had ever seen.Ronaldo scored his first goal for Manchester United with a free-kick in a 3–0 win over Portsmouth on 1 November. Three other league goals followed in the second half of the campaign,the last of which came against Aston Villa on the final day of the season, a match in which he also received his first red card.Ronaldo ended his first season in English football by scoring the opening goal in United's 3–0 victory over Millwall in the FA Cup final, earning his first trophy. </p>

<!--Ronaldo was at his best-->
<p class="thick">Real Madrid</p>
<p>Ahead of the 2009–10 season, Ronaldo joined Real Madrid for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_expensive_association_football_transfers">world record transfer feeV</a> at the time, of £80 million (€94 million). His contract, which ran until 2015, was worth €11 million per year and contained a €1 billion buy-out clause.At least 80,000 fans attended his presentation at the Santiago Bernabéu, surpassing the 25-year record of 75,000 fans who had welcomed Diego Maradona at Napoli.Since club captain Raúl already wore the number 7, the number Ronaldo wore at Manchester United,Ronaldo received the number 9 shirt, which was presented to him by former Madrid player Alfredo Di Stéfano</p>

<p>At the start of his seventh season at Real Madrid, the 2015–16 campaign, Ronaldo became the club's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Real_Madrid_CF_records_and_statistics#Goalscorers">all-time top scorer</a>, first in the league and then in all competitions. His five-goal haul in a 6–0 away win over Espanyol on 12 September took his tally in La Liga to 230 goals in 203 games, surpassing the club's previous recordholder, Raúl. A month later, on 17 October, he again surpassed Raúl when he scored the second goal in a 3–0 defeat of Levante at the Bernabéu to take his overall total for the club to 324 goals.[note 4] Ronaldo also became the all-time top scorer in the Champions League with a hat-trick in the first group match against Shakhtar Donetsk, having finished the previous season level with Messi on 77 goals.A brace against Malmö FF, scoring in a 2–0 away win on 30 September, saw him reach the milestone of 500 career goals for both club and country. He subsequently became the first player to score double figures in the competition's group stage, setting the record at 11 goals, including another four-goal haul against Malmö</p>

<p>Ronaldo missed Real Madrid's first three matches of the 2016–17 season, including the 2016 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla, as he continued to rehabilitate the knee injury he suffered against France in the final of Euro 2016.On 15 September, Ronaldo did not celebrate his late free kick equaliser against Sporting CP in the Champions League, with Ronaldo stating post match, "they made me who I am." On 6 November, Ronaldo signed a new contract set to keep him with Madrid until 2021.On 19 November, he scored a hat-trick in a 3–0 away win against Atlético Madrid, making him the all-time top scorer in the Madrid derby with 18 goals. On 15 December, Ronaldo scored his 500th club career goal in the 2–0 victory over Club América in the semi-finals of the FIFA Club World Cup.He then scored a hat-trick in the 4–2 win over Japanese club Kashima Antlers in the final.Ronaldo finished the tournament as top scorer with four goals and was also named the best player of the tournament.He won the Ballon d'Or for a fourth time and the inaugural Best FIFA Men's Player, a revival of the former <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Player_of_the_Year">FIFA World Player of the Year</a>, largely owing to his success with Portugal in winning Euro 2016</p>

<!--A New Starting for Ronaldo-->
<p class="thick">Juventus</p>
<p>After eight days of transfer speculation concerning Italian club Juventus, on 10 July 2018, Ronaldo signed a four-year contract with them after completing a €100 million transfer, which included an additional €12 million in other fees and solidarity contributions to Ronaldo's youth clubs. The transfer was the highest ever for a player over 30 years old, and the highest ever paid by an Italian club.Upon signing, Ronaldo cited his need for a new challenge as his rationale for departing Real Madrid,but later on he attributed the transfer to the lack of support he felt was shown by club president <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florentino_Pérez">Florentino Pérez.</a></p>

<p>Ronaldo made his official debut for Juventus in their opening Serie A match on 18 August, a 3–2 away win over Chievo.On 16 September, his fourth appearance for Juventus, he scored his first goal, which was immediately followed by a second, in a 2–1 home win over Sassuolo; the latter was the 400th league goal of his career. On 19 September, in his first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018–19_UEFA_Champions_League">Champions League</a> match for Juventus, he was sent off in the 29th minute for "violent conduct"—the first time in 154 Champions League appearances—in an eventual 2–0 away win over Valencia,and was awarded a one-game suspension. Ronaldo scored his first Champions League goal for Juventus in a 2–1 home loss to his former club Manchester United. In that month, he became the first player in history to win 100 Champions League matches, setting up Mario Mandžukić's winner in a 1–0 home victory over Valencia, which sealed Juventus's passage to the knock-out stages of the competition. In December, he scored his tenth Serie A goal of the season, from the penalty spot, netting the final goal in a 3–0 away win over rivals Fiorentina; with this goal, Ronaldo became the first Juventus player since John Charles in 1957 to score 10 goals in his first 14 league games for the club.After placing second in both the UEFA Men's Player of the Year and The Best FIFA Men's Player for the first time in three years, behind Luka Modrić, Ronaldo performances in 2018 also saw him voted runner-up for the 2018 Ballon d'Or, finishing once again behind his former Real Madrid teammate</p>
